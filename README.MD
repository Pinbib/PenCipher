After the repository has been copied, go to the directory where it was copied and transfer the PenCipher.exe file to ```C:\Windows\System32```.

Then open a terminal by running this command and following the instructions in the terminal:

```pencipher [PathToFile]```

After that, you should be asked for a key, and then in the directory where the file you specified was located, a new one will appear with the same name but with the extension ".pc", but if the file you specified already had this extension, decryption will be carried out and the same file will be created but with the extension ".txt".
